# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository serves as a collection of solutions to various data structures and algorithms questions. As I navigate through this coding journey, I aim to build a comprehensive set of solutions that cover different problem-solving techniques and concepts.

## Table of Contents

1. **Arrays**

2. **Linked Lists**

3. **Trees**

4. **Sorting**

5. **Searching**


## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute a solution or add a new question:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b new-feature`.
3. Add your solution or question with a clear markdown file (e.g., `question1.md`).
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solution to Question 1"`.
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`.
6. Open a pull request.

Feel free to explore the solutions, suggest improvements, or contribute new questions. Let's build a resource that can help others on their coding journey!
